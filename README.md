# A simple(ish) Apache Cordova + React.js + Typescript application #
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brycekbargar/GreenOrPink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brycekbargar/GreenOrPink)

I've officially EOF'd this.
- I learned what I wanted out of it (React + Travis CI + ES6)
- I changed jobs and have no commute!
- I really have no interest in Cordova...

I may revisit and try to learn Browserify/Webpack. But probably not.

Note: You probably shouldn't use this as any sort of template. It was just an abandoned experiment.
